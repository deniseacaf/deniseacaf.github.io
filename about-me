Hi my name is Denise Florez
I am a digital editor and I worked on the homepage of latimes.com
Previously I was a web producer for the Lifestyle, Travel and Food sections. I still work with features often. 
My previous work includes working in Spanish weeklies as a reporter and music critic.
I also have experience translating and interpreting between Spanish and English.
